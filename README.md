A fully scalable REST API using FastAPI (Python) to handle requests for in-demand IT skills and technologies across various job titles. Created Python web scraping solutions to extract and update data from numerous job market websites, ensuring real-time accuracy and relevance. Stored and organized the scraped data and statistics in a MySQL database. Utilized SerpAPI for certain tasks and built a React frontend to display the statistics.
